# Tutorial

The `mlr3oml` package provides a clean interface to integerate OpenML into the mlr3
ecosystem. Within R, there exists an OML class for the various OpenML objects (flows, runs, ...).
These can be converted to mlr3 objects by calling the `$convert()` method.

This example illustrates the general idea.

```r
oml_flow = OMLFlow$new(xxx)
oml_task = OMLTask$new(59L)
learner = oml_flow$convert()
task = oml_task$convert()
resampling = oml_task$resampling$convert()

rr = resample(task, learner, resampling)
publish(rr)
```
